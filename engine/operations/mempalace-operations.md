# MemPalace operations

> Install, initialize, populate, and capture-on-stop. MemPalace is the project's semantic memory: drawers (verbatim memories) organized into rooms (topics) within wings (projects), connected by halls (intra-wing) and tunnels (inter-wing). For tag conventions, see [`mempalace-tagging-conventions.md`](mempalace-tagging-conventions.md).

## What MemPalace does for Paideia

It captures the conversational substrate that ADRs and ENGINE_LOG can't hold:

- **Exploration sessions** — "we considered X, rejected for Y" — so future sessions don't re-litigate.
- **Decision moments** — the verbatim reasoning at the moment a commitment was settled (the *story* behind the ADR's *contract*).
- **Work logs** — what a build session actually did, indexed by similarity for cold-start retrieval.

Two layers of decision recording (per CLAUDE.md): ADRs are the contract, MemPalace is the story.

## Architecture (4-level hierarchy)

```
Wing      (project or person, e.g., "paideia")
└── Room  (topic, e.g., "operations", "self-correction")
    └── Closet  (summary nodes derived from drawers)
        └── Drawer  (verbatim memory; the atomic unit)
```

**Halls** connect rooms within a wing (cross-topic links). **Tunnels** connect rooms across wings (cross-project links). Most queries traverse drawers via similarity search; halls and tunnels surface when explicitly traversed.

## Install

MemPalace 3.3.3 ships as a Python package. Installed at user-scope:

```
/Users/<user>/Library/Python/3.9/bin/mempalace
/Users/<user>/Library/Python/3.9/bin/mempalace-mcp
```

The MCP server (`mempalace-mcp`) is registered in `.mcp.json` (gitignored — contains no secrets but kept local for parity with the Supabase entry):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mempalace": {
      "command": "/Users/shanekidd/Library/Python/3.9/bin/mempalace-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after editing `.mcp.json` for the server to load.

## Initialize against this repo

Run from the repo root, against the relocated `docs/` directory (post-S-0001 reorganization):

```bash
mempalace init docs/
mempalace mine docs/
```

`init` auto-detects rooms from folder structure — `docs/operations/` becomes the `operations` room, top-level `.md` files become drawers in a `general` or wing-default room. `mine` does first-pass content extraction: every `.md` file becomes one or more drawers tagged with its filename.

Verify with `mempalace status` and `mempalace_list_rooms` (MCP tool). Expect at least: `operations`, plus a room per top-level docs subdirectory if any (none currently — all design docs are flat under `docs/`).

## Capture on session events (Claude Code hooks)

MemPalace 3.3.3 does **not** auto-capture conversations. Capture requires Claude Code hooks wired in `.claude/settings.json`. Two hook types:

- **Stop hook** — fires after every 15 human messages. Tracks save points per session in `~/.mempalace/hook_state/`. Honors `stop_hook_active` to prevent infinite loops.
- **PreCompact hook** — fires before context compaction. Always blocks with a comprehensive save instruction (compaction means the AI is about to lose detailed context).

Both hooks invoke the same binary, behind a wrapper that surfaces capture failures to a log file:

```
echo '{"session_id":"...","stop_hook_active":false,"transcript_path":"..."}' | tools/hooks/mempalace-hook-wrapper.sh --hook stop --harness claude-code
```

The wrapper ([`tools/hooks/mempalace-hook-wrapper.sh`](../tools/hooks/mempalace-hook-wrapper.sh)) passes args and stdin through to `mempalace hook run`, captures the exit code and stderr, and appends a single timestamped success/failure line to `.claude/logs/mempalace-hook.log` (gitignored — per-clone state). It always exits 0 to the harness, so capture issues never block the session. The next session's boot procedure reads the log and surfaces unacknowledged failure entries; see [`session-build-lifecycle.md`](session-build-lifecycle.md)'s Recovery section.

Configuration in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "tools/hooks/mempalace-hook-wrapper.sh --hook stop --harness claude-code"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "tools/hooks/mempalace-hook-wrapper.sh --hook precompact --harness claude-code"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note: `.gitignore` previously excluded `.claude/*` (with an exception only for `.claude/commands/`). For `settings.json` to ship with the repo, add an exception:

```
!.claude/settings.json
```

`settings.local.json` remains gitignored — it carries per-developer permissions.

## Querying from inside Claude Code

The MemPalace MCP server exposes ~19 tools. Highest-frequency ones:

- `mempalace_search` — semantic search across drawers; returns verbatim content with similarity scores. Use short keyword queries (max 250 chars). Filter with `wing` / `room` for scoped recall.
- `mempalace_list_rooms` / `mempalace_list_wings` / `mempalace_list_drawers` — directory listings.
- `mempalace_kg_query` — knowledge-graph traversal across closets.
- `mempalace_diary_read` — reads the per-day session diary.
- `mempalace_add_drawer` — manual capture (use sparingly; the hooks handle most cases).
- `mempalace_status` — palace overview.

Tag conventions (`exploration` / `decision` / `work`) live in [`mempalace-tagging-conventions.md`](mempalace-tagging-conventions.md).

## Verifying capture is working

After S-0002 hooks land, run a build session and confirm:

```bash
mempalace status
# Expect: drawer count > 0, last write timestamp matches recent activity
```

If drawers aren't appearing: check `~/.mempalace/hook_state/` for stale lock files; check `mempalace --version` (must be 3.3.3+); check that Claude Code restarted after the `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json` edits.
