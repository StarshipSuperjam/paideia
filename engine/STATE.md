# Project State

> The single file every session reads first. Names what's current and what's next. Updated at every build-session close.
>
> **Scope discipline.** This file describes present state only. Session-by-session history lives in `engine/session/archive/S-NNNN.json` (canonical structured archive per ADR 0042) and `engine/ENGINE_LOG.md` (Keep-a-Changelog-style material-change entries). Cross-reference into those surfaces; do not duplicate their content here. The 37 prior-session prose rows S-0081–S-0119 retired at S-0121 per audit-session inline cleanup — they were duplicating archive + ENGINE_LOG content. Any addition to this file must answer: *would a session reading only STATE.md need this to know what's current?* If the content is "what happened last session," it belongs in the archive + ENGINE_LOG.

## Current

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Project** | Paideia — knowledge mastery app on a pedagogical dependency graph |
| **GitHub** | https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia (OSS, Apache 2.0; public-flip landed at S-0130 with tag [`oss-flip-v1.0.0`](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/releases/tag/oss-flip-v1.0.0)) |
| **Current phase** | **Phase 5 — Philosophy subdomain seeding (closed; S-0045 → S-0076; production-audit closeout at S-0122; production-audit follow-up migrations at S-0123).** 380 nodes + 532 edges (was 536 pre-S-0123; -4 from 0063 prunes); 515 `pedagogical_prerequisite` + 17 `historical_influence` (predicate first-use at S-0123 per ADR 0061 product). Phase 5 build closeout report at [`engine/build_readiness/phase_5_closeout.md`](build_readiness/phase_5_closeout.md); production-audit findings at [`engine/build_readiness/phase_5_production_audit_findings.md`](build_readiness/phase_5_production_audit_findings.md); audit-system-input at [`engine/build_readiness/phase_5_audit_system_input.md`](build_readiness/phase_5_audit_system_input.md); follow-up migrations at [`product/seed-graph/migrations/0061_seed_historical_influence_retyping_part1.sql`](../product/seed-graph/migrations/0061_seed_historical_influence_retyping_part1.sql) / [`0062_seed_direction_flips_part1.sql`](../product/seed-graph/migrations/0062_seed_direction_flips_part1.sql) / [`0062_seed_direction_flips_revert_part1.sql`](../product/seed-graph/migrations/0062_seed_direction_flips_revert_part1.sql) / [`0063_seed_weak_edge_cleanup_part1.sql`](../product/seed-graph/migrations/0063_seed_weak_edge_cleanup_part1.sql) / [`0064_seed_evidence_annotations_part1.sql`](../product/seed-graph/migrations/0064_seed_evidence_annotations_part1.sql). T1-A through T1-D closed for [`engine/tools/fetch_structural_reference.py`](tools/fetch_structural_reference.py) at S-0122 closeout. Phase 6 self-correction master plan blocked behind OQ-DEC1 settlement; the audit-side closeout + follow-up execution is complete. **The OSS+BYOK three-session refactor completed: Session A at S-0128 ([ADR 0065](../product/adr/0065-oss-pivot-and-byok-disposition.md) supersedes 0029 + 0035); Session B at S-0129 (downstream doc rewrites); Session C at S-0130 (LICENSE Apache 2.0 + NOTICE/CONTRIBUTING/CODE_OF_CONDUCT authoring + SECURITY.md/README.md OSS rewrites + 141-file PII path sweep + `.claude/settings.json` cleanup; public-visibility flip held at halt-and-confirm gate at session close).** **SWE-hardening rollout — Tier 1 CLOSED, Tier 2 partial.** Tier 1 closed: #65 lockfile (S-0127 / ADR 0064); Pairing B #68 CI mirror + #69 branch protection (S-0131 / ADR 0065 engine + ADR 0066); Pairing A #66 gitleaks + #70 bandit (S-0132 / ADR 0067 + ADR 0068); #67 Dependabot (S-0133 / ADR 0069). Tier 2 closed: Pairing A #70 bandit SAST (S-0132 / ADR 0068, paired with #66); **Pairing C #73 `/review` + #74 `/security-review` (S-0134 / ADR 0070 + ADR 0071)**. Tier 2 open: #71 pytest-cov + #72 issue templates + #75 frontend-ui-engineering (priority:urgent, Phase 6 entry precondition). ADR collection: **73 (69 Accepted + 4 Superseded; 36 engine + 37 product)** — engine ADRs 0070 + 0071 landed at S-0134. Full session-by-session history in [`engine/ENGINE_LOG.md`](ENGINE_LOG.md). |
| **Last build session** | **S-0134 (2026-05-12) — SWE-hardening Tier 2 Pairing C: project-wired `/review` + `/security-review` skills.** Two engine ADRs ([0070](adr/0070-project-wired-review-skill.md) project-wired five-axis `/review` + [0071](adr/0071-project-wired-security-review-skill.md) project-wired OWASP-Top-10 `/security-review`) + two MemPalace `decision` drawers + new [`.claude/skills/review/`](../.claude/skills/review/) (SKILL.md + anti-rationalization.md as the canonical shared reference table) + new [`.claude/skills/security-review/`](../.claude/skills/security-review/) (SKILL.md + owasp-checklist.md + paideia-overlays.md). Closes [Issue #73](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/73) + [Issue #74](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/74) — Pairing C in one session per the same-session-pairing rationale ("identical authoring pattern, #73's anti-rationalization table is explicitly reused by #74"). Both skills carry `disable-model-invocation: true` per ADR 0044. Pattern source: `addyosmani/agent-skills/skills/{code-review-and-quality,security-and-hardening}` (adapted, not cloned — Paideia overlays scope_lock-awareness + ADR-citation requirement + MemPalace decision-drawer check + Supabase RLS semantic verification + ADR 0055 Layer 2.5 postcondition-assertion verification + MemPalace+KG PII discipline are project-specific additions). **Pushback applied at planning time**: the Issue bodies asserted "First-exercise readiness note per ADR 0053. Cross-cutting" — overridden by explicit rubric evaluation against ADR 0053's four criteria in each new ADR's Consequences. Zero criteria satisfied per skill → no first-exercise readiness note required; the negative-finding evaluation block (mirroring ADR 0069's precedent at S-0133) is the binding judgment. First real invocation of each skill is the empirical verification, captured in the ADRs' "Empirical record (pending)" subsections. Three commits this session: eager-claim + deliverable batch + closeout. Soft-warns persistent only — `issue_collision` 21 (stable; -5 from S-0133 because two Issues #73 + #74 close this session and their commit-message keyword overlap drops), `missing_rigor_score` 360 (stable), `orphan_leaf` 1 (stable). No new soft-warn categories. ADR collection: **73 (69 Accepted + 4 Superseded; 36 engine + 37 product)** — engine ADRs 0070 + 0071 landed at S-0134. |


## Next session work item

**S-0135 — pick the next eligible SWE-hardening unit per the rollout's Pickup rule below.** Tier 1 closed at S-0133 (Dependabot via ADR 0069). Tier 2 Pairing C closed at S-0134 (/review + /security-review via ADRs 0070 + 0071). The naturally-next eligible units are:

- **[Issue #71](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/71) pytest-cov** — Tier 2. Coverage measurement + measured floor authoring; extends `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (Pairing B's foundation). Cross-cutting (introduces a regression-trend gate); requires first-exercise readiness note per [ADR 0053](adr/0053-mechanism-first-exercise-gate.md) — re-evaluate the rubric at authoring time per the Pairing C precedent (criterion 2 may now satisfy if pytest-cov adds a new validator soft-warn for floor-regression). Touches `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` + new `.coveragerc` + workflow extension + PR template extension + ADR + (possibly) readiness note.
- **[Issue #72](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/72)** GitHub issue templates — Tier 2; zero blockers; small surface (8 type-label YAML templates + config + ADR).
- **[Issue #75](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/75)** `frontend-ui-engineering` skill (`priority:urgent`) — Tier 2; precondition for Phase 6 frontend entry. Phase 6 entry independently blocked behind OQ-DEC1 settlement, so priority is "land before any Phase 6 frontend session opens", not "land before any other work."

**Tier 1 verification still pending**: wait until Monday 2026-05-18 for the first Dependabot run. Expected: at most one PR per ecosystem (pip + github-actions), grouped minor/patch, commit message `chore(deps): bump ...`. Verification recorded in ADR 0069's "Empirical record" subsection or in the next session's `outcome_summary`.

**Pairing C verification still pending**: first real invocation of `/review` and `/security-review` against substantive changes. Captured in ADR 0070's + ADR 0071's "Empirical record (pending)" subsections, or in the invoking session's `outcome_summary`. AI may surface invocation as a suggestion on substantive code changes (the user adjudicates).

Open Issues backlog (per [`engine/ENGINE_LOG.md`](ENGINE_LOG.md) `[Unreleased]` and the GitHub Issue list): SWE-hardening Tier 1 CLOSED (#65/#66/#67/#68/#69/#70); Tier 2 CLOSED in this batch (#73 + #74); Tier 2 open: #71 pytest-cov + #72 issue templates + #75 priority:urgent skill; Phase 6 prep work behind OQ-DEC1 settlement; Issue #62 validator soft-warns; Issue #64 CB-E-63 re-scoping; #91 duplicate ADR 0052; #92 cohort_id lingering migration. Issue #2 (mempalace wing-name derivation) stays OPEN with S-0132 recurrence comment; upstream-blocked.

## SWE-hardening rollout

> Authored at session-pre-S-0124 (date 2026-05-11) from the audit plan at `~/.claude/plans/not-a-working-session-sequential-twilight.md`. Comparing Paideia's posture against [`affaan-m/everything-claude-code`](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) and [`addyosmani/agent-skills`](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) produced 22 GitHub Issues (#65–#86) across three tiers + analysis-outcomes. **Each adoption is ADR-tracked per its discipline; sessions default to single-Issue scope BUT may bundle declared pairings (see "Combined-session pairings" below — three pairings declared at S-0125).** Cross-cutting mechanisms additionally require a first-exercise readiness note per [ADR 0053](adr/0053-mechanism-first-exercise-gate.md).

**Pickup rule.** A future session reads this section and picks the next *eligible unit* (single Issue OR a declared combined-session pairing — see "Combined-session pairings" below) with no remaining blockers. The boot surface (per [`issue-discipline.md`](operations/issue-discipline.md)) counts the underlying Issues in the standard backlog totals; this section adds the dependency + trigger + pairing structure the count cannot encode.

### Combined-session pairings

Three pairings declared at S-0125 after audit of the S-0124 rollout. Per the feedback memory "Don't split work into multiple sessions to hedge on length", session-per-Issue was the default — not a hard constraint. Each pairing lands two ADRs + two MemPalace `decision` drawers + (where applicable) two first-exercise readiness notes in one session.

| Pairing | Issues | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **A — pre-commit security scanners** | [#66](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/66) + [#70](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/70) | Both extend `engine/tools/hooks/pre-commit`, both add tooling config + version pin, both add `validate.py` integration, both add first-exercise readiness notes. #70's Issue body explicitly declares *"Pairs with: #66"*. Ordering: #70 is blocked by #65 + #68, so the combined session lands after #65 and #68 close. |
| **B — GitHub gating layer** | [#68](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/68) + [#69](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/69) | Hard sequential coupling — #69's branch-protection rule requires #68's CI status check to exist before configuration makes sense. Both touch `.github/` exclusively; same scope_lock surface. Splitting forces the second session to rebuild eager-claim/routine-push posture context cold. |
| **C — code-review skills** | [#73](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/73) + [#74](https://github.com/StarshipSuperjam/paideia/issues/74) | Both author Skills in `.claude/skills/` adapted from `addyosmani/agent-skills`; identical authoring pattern (`disable-model-invocation: true`, scope_lock awareness, ADR-citation requirement). #73's anti-rationalization table is explicitly reused by #74. |

Issue bodies remain individually trackable; the pairings are surfaced here as the routing layer.

### Trigger surface — re-check at every session boot

| When this becomes true | Action |
|---|---|
| Phase 6 frontend stack is being chosen | **#75 must already be done.** If not, halt Phase 6 entry until it lands. |
| Phase 6 frontend session opens | Re-evaluate #79 for first-pass perf budgets |
| Phase 6 backend API surface opens | Action #85 |
| Phase 9 approach OR pre-launch beta decided | Action #82 |
| Deployable artifact (container, bundle, package) exists | Action #83; re-evaluate #79 with real measurements |
| Second collaborator added | Promote #80 to ADR-tracked; action #84 |
| Phase 6 complete (audit-style review window) | Action #84 |

### Explicit non-adoptions (no Issue filed; decision recorded here)

| Item | Source | Reason for skip |
|---|---|---|
| ECC agents (`planner`, `chief-of-staff`, `loop-operator`, `e2e-runner`) | ECC | Conflict with [ADR 0044](adr/0044-skill-conversion-recipe-vs-reference.md), [ADR 0049](adr/0049-scope-lock-at-boot-and-descope-reorder-audit-at-shutdown.md), [ADR 0051](adr/0051-routine-mode-and-engine-loop.md) — existing session/Skill/scope apparatus covers this surface differently and more rigorously |
| ECC skills under `agent-*` / `agentic-engineering` | ECC | Same conflict |
| ECC slash commands wrapping agents/skills | ECC | Not portable; tied to ECC harness |
| ECC `ecc_dashboard.py`, identity / package-manager configs | ECC | Bound to ECC harness model |
| ECC per-language build resolvers | ECC | Python-only on engine; multi-language coverage is a Phase 6 stack-specific decision in-context |
| agent-skills `using-agent-skills` meta-skill | agent-skills | ADR 0044 Skill discipline (recipe-vs-reference partition) is more rigorous |
| agent-skills `git-workflow-and-versioning` (wholesale) | agent-skills | Trunk-based-default conflicts with session ritual; compatible patterns extracted into #86 (revert/rollback discipline) |
| agent-skills `ci-cd-and-automation` (wholesale) | agent-skills | ECC workflows are the pattern source; judgment patterns (no-skip philosophy, 10-min budget, flaky-test discipline, GitHub-Secrets-for-test-creds) baked directly into #68 body |
| Build Cop role from CI skill | agent-skills | Solo-dev not applicable; promote when ≥2 collaborators |

Rejecting any of these later requires explicit reversal (new ADR or amendment to this rollout section).
